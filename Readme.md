# 2dGameDeveloper
2D Game Developer is a basic IDE for 2D games through which any average user can use his creativity to build up cool, addictive 2D games like flappy bird, Mario, etc. without the need of knowing and learning any programming language.

#Current Status
Half Basic classes are roughly built and sufficient to develop a game close to Mario(have already built a demo named TEMPESTAS) but with no GUI, i.e., user still need to know basics of Java. It has yet been tested only on Windows 7 and XP.
Eg: To create a '2Dblock' and to add it in the Universe following block of code needs to be written up.

Block b1 = new block();
Universe2D.defaultUniverse.addObject2Ds(b1);
b1.setBounds(new Rectangle2D(0, 0, 10, 10));

# Future of this project
1. Base Library : Base Libraries needs to be improved and some more fundamental concepts like splitting of objects in two, liquid objects, artificial intelligence, etc. needs to be implemented. 
2. High level interface : High level interface needs to be populated with many varieties enabling users to seemlessly create different types of games.
3. GUI : We look forward to start to create a base for GUI, enabling to build up a environment in which average users with minimal knowledge of programming can start to make some basic games as in the demo/Tempestas.

# For Developers
This is still a very young project and needs a lot of input before output can be seen. Feel free to go through the code and suggest improvements or even new modules. For more information contact the author through mail.
